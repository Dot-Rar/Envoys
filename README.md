# About
Envoys is a very configurable envoy/supply drop plugin. You can set locations for envoys (Loot chests) which will respawn every x seconds with loot configurable in the configuration file or, you can let them spawn randomly around your worlds.

# This Repository
Unfortunately, due to malpractice by some users in the community, I am refraining from open sourcing Envoys (however, the [Lite version is open source](https://github.com/Dot-Rar/EnvoysLite)).

The sole purpose of this repository is to serve as an [issue tracker](https://github.com/Dot-Rar/Envoys/issues), and to also provide [documentation](https://github.com/Dot-Rar/Envoys/wiki) for use.
